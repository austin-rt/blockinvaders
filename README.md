### **_Description_**

This is a multi level, in-browser version of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. The user controla a block with the ability to shoot and move left or right. The enemy descends toward the player. If the player defeats all Space Invader blocks, the user automatically moves to the next level. As the level increments both the speed of the invaders descension and the bullet travel speed increase while the shooting cooldown time decreases.
